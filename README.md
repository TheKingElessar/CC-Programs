# I will _always_ survive.

___

## General to-do list:

 * More interesting wandering
 	+ Return to its home
	+ Navigate between rooms
 
## Pathfinding to-do list:

 * Make it navigate the final path
	+ Have to refine the code that records/updates it's "facing" value. What if it has to zig-zag? Can't depend on moving forward a block to figure out which way it's facing.
 * Make it map the room
 	+ Circle, starting at the outside and spiraling inwards?
